    <h4>Fleischmann's&reg; Easy Pizza Crust:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needede</li>
      <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S® Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise® 
          Yeast
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
      <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Toppings:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL® Pepperoni</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium 
          bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze 
          remaining paste .
      </li>
      <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and 
          salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 
          minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, 
          sticky dough ball is formed.
      </li>
      <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth 
          and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, 
          let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
      </li>
      <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch 
          greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.
      </li>
      <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, 
          pepperoni and cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is 
          bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom 
          oven racks halfway through baking.
      </li>
    </ol>
